# Markdown Reporter

- Write your reports with Markdown
- Let your database convert Markdown code blocks containing SQL queries to CSV data or Markdown tables
- Let [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) convert your Markdown reports to HTML or high quality LaTeX PDF's with vector based inline charts generated by Pythons matplotlib on your CSV data

## Three Main Components

- A Oracle PL/SQL Package for preprocessing your data and communicating with the printserver
- A Node.js based printserver, which is in fact a web based remote shell for the format converter Pandoc
- A Pandoc filter written in Python, which intercepts the converting process and generates the charts based on the preprocessed CSV data

Currently supported is only the Oracle database, but the PL/SQL logic is very small and can be adapted to other database systems - contributors are welcome to do this adaption or to help by improving the Python filter to support more chart types.

## How To Get Started

You need to install the following Open Source Software:

- [Pandoc & LaTeX](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Python (3.x)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - Upgrade packet manager pip: `pip3 install -U pip` (Linux/OS X) or `python -m pip install -U pip` (Windows)
    - `pip3 install matplotlib`
    - `pip3 install pandas`
    - `pip3 install seaborn`
    - `pip3 install jupyter`

Under windows you can get errors by installing seaborn or using numpy. These errors are normally because of missing compilers. You can find precompiled versions of the needed packages here - please choose the right ones for your Python and Windows version (32/64 bit): [scipy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy), [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy). You can install then the files with this call: `pip install localDownloadedFileName`

If you are behind a proxy, then you can use `pip3 install --proxy=yourProxyURL packageName`. For the following Node.js installation you can also set the proxy in this way: `npm config set proxy yourProxyURL` and/or `npm config set https-proxy yourHttpsProxyURL`

- Download and unpack [Markdown Reporter](https://github.com/ogobrecht/markdown-reporter/releases/latest)
- Call in the root directory (containing package.json) `npm install`
- Then start the printserver by calling `node app.js`
- In your browser call http://localhost:3000, play around with the [Pandoc example form](http://localhost:3000/pandoc/example-form) and check if everything is working like expected
- As the last step install in your database the Markdown Reporter helper package (located in the subdirectory `oracle_plsql`) and configure in the body the printserver URL - don't forget to setup a network ACL for your new printserver
- Optional you can install the APEX demo application located in the subdirectory `oracle_apex`, which has the APEX Mardown plugin preinstalled

Now it is time to check, if your system is working correct. It is strongly recommended to test your report functionality always locally first, especially the PDF format. If you use some extra LaTeX functionality then it could be, your LaTeX distribution wants to install the needed packages. It is also normal, that LaTeX needs more time to render on the first run, because it maybe needs to compile used fonts or packages. The same applies to Python by compiling machine specific code on the first run.

The directory structure of the Markdown Reporter:

```
|--data
   |--dev
      convert.bat
      convert.portable.bat
      document.md
   |--prod
      convert.bat
   |--templates
   |--userprofile
|--docs
   markdown-reporter.ipynb
|--node_modules
|--oracle_apex
   demo_app.sql
|--oracle_plsql
   markdown_reporter.pks
   markdown_reporter_body.pkb
|--pandoc_filter
   pandocFilterMarkdownReporter.py
   pandocfiltersFileBased.py

.gitignore
app.js
app-example-form.html
app-index.html
package.json
README.md
```

In `data/dev` you will develop and test your shell-command, which is called later on from Node.js. The shipped convert.bat can be the starting point for your customizing. If you are done you copy it over to the `prod folder`. The app.js is developed to run OS independend, but currently only tested under Windows. Thats is also the reason why currently a shell command for Linux/Mac is missing. If you plan to run under Linux/Mac, you have to modify the app.js and replace then the convert.bat with convert.sh or whatever you call your shell command.

The pandoc option `--data-dir` is set to the `data` directory. You can put your custom templates in the subdirectory `data/templates`. Pandoc is searching there for the default templates. See also the [pandoc readme](http://pandoc.org/README.html#general-options)

Node is creating for each conversion a temporary folder under the `data` directory. If somethings is going wrong during the conversion, the folder is not deleted - you are able to go into this folder and analyze the problem. The originally used shell command and options are prepended to the command.bat in the temporary folder.

If you have ideas for the Node.js backend or the conversion process please let me know and become a contributor to this project :-)

If your system is working locally then it is time to check it over a HTTP connection from within your database:

```
SELECT httpuritype('http://yourHost:yourPort/pandoc').getclob() FROM dual;
```

Now try to convert your first report by calling this example Markdown:

    SELECT markdown_reporter.convert_document(p_format   => 'pdf'
                                             ,p_markdown => markdown_reporter.preprocess_data(p_markdown => q'[

    ``` { .sql .chart .bar }

      FROM dual
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Rio', 30000, 35000, 38000

    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Tokio', 40000, 42000, 44000
      FROM dual;
    ```

    ``` { .sql .chart .barh }
    SELECT 'New York' AS "location"
           ,20000 AS "sales 2015"
           ,30000 AS "sales 2016"
           ,35000 AS "sales 2017"
      FROM dual
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Rio', 30000, 35000, 38000
      FROM dual
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Tokio', 40000, 42000, 44000
      FROM dual;
    ```
    ]'))
      FROM dual;

You can see in this example, that Pandoc is able to read meta data from a YAML header. You can also place in this YAML header so called header-includes for LaTeX to avoid modifying Pandoc's LaTeX template.

## Chart Development

Currently three chart types are delivered with Markdown Reporter: pie, bar and bar horizontal (called barh in matplotlib)

For chart development it is recommended to install all software local on your desktop PC and start then the Jupyter notebook server by calling the shell command `jupyter notebook`. In the Markdown Reporter subdirectory docs you will find an example notebook (markdown-reporter.ipynb) - you can use this as an starting point for your customizing and new chart types.

If you have created some new chart logic then it is time to modify the Pandoc filter `pandoc_filter/pandocFilterMarkdownReporter.py` and also to become a contributor for this project :-)
